This repository contains course project codes of the student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), The University of Maryland, College Park. The course page is located here (at mercy of the course instructor) https://www.ece.umd.edu/class/enee765.F2017/


Linear_Nonlinear_Consensus.m - This contains different kinds of topologies with single/double integrator models with linear and nonlinear protocols. Refer pages 3-5 in the PDF

Sensor_Fusion_Consensus.m - This demonstrates how fusing data from multiple agents ultimately leads to correct consensus. Refer pages 6-7 in the PDF

Nearest_Neighbor_Consensus.m - This shows how, despite the lack of centralized coordination and continual changes in the neighbors of an agent, they eventually move in the same direction. Refer page 7 in the PDF

Anderson_Brockett_estimates.m - This compares the Anderson and Brockett convergence estimates for a 3-agent topology. Refer pages 5-6 in the PDF

Decentralized.m - Here we study decentralized adaptive laws that are robust to uncertainties. Refer pages 8-9 in the PDF
